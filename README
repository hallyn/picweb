1. Set picsdir in picweb.py to some path, i.e. $HOME/pics.
2. Create that picsdir
3. Under picsdir are the following directories:
   a. 'all': everyone who can log in will be able to see pictures under here
   b. '%user%' these match usernames in the passwords dict in picweb.py.
      Only %user% can see pictures under here.
   c. static.  The 'all' and '%user' directory trees must be mirrored here
      so as to be able to serve images.
4. Set port in picweb.py to the port you wish to use
5. Add users and passwords to the passwords dict in picweb.py.  The password
   field should be the result of 'echo -n $pwd | sha256sum'.

Under the 'all' and '%user%' directories you may serve any sort of
directory hierarchy that you like.
